**Purpose:** Coding artefact for SMU MITB AI track application

**Description:** Running the script will open up the classic snake game. The game is created using Python 3.8 and using Tkinter for GUI and Pillow (PIL fork) for opening/loading the images.

**Remarks:** Following a video guide online, I have written the codes from scratch and added my own comments.
